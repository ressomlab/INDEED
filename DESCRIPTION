Title: Integrated Differential Expression and Differential Network Analysis (INDEED)
Version: 1.2.0
Author: Yiming Zuo with contributions from Kian Ghaffari and Zhenzhi Li
Maintainer: Yiming Zuo <yimingzuo@gmail.com> and Kian Ghaffari <kg737@georgetown.edu>
Description: An R package for integrated differential expression and differential network analysis 
    based on omic data for cancer biomarker discovery. Both correlation and partial correlation
    can be used to generate differential network to aid the traditional differential expression 
    analysis to identify changes between biomolecules on both their expression and pairwise 
    association levels.
