\usage{
network_display(
  results = NULL,
  nodesize = "P_Value",
  nodecolor = "Activity_Score",
  edgewidth = "NO",
  layout = "nice"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{This is the result from calling either non_partial_corr() or partial_corr().}

\item{nodesize}{This parameter determines what the size of each node will represent. The options 
are 'Node_Degree', 'Activity_Score','P_Value' and 'Z_Score'. The title of the resulting 
network will identify which parameter was selected to represent the node size. The default 
is P_Value.}

\item{nodecolor}{This parameter determines what color each node will be based on a yellow to 
blue color gradient. The options are 'Node_Degree', 'Activity_Score', 'P_Value', and '
Z_Score'. A color bar will be created based on which parameter is chosen. The default is
Activity_Score.}

\item{edgewidth}{This is a 'YES' or 'NO' option as to if the edgewidth should be representative 
of the weight value corresponding to the correlation change between two nodes. The default 
is NO.}

\item{layout}{User can choose from a a handful of network visualization templates including:
'nice', 'sphere', 'grid', 'star', and 'circle'. The default is nice.}
}
\value{
An interactive dipiction of the network resulting from INDEED functions 
    non_partial_corr() or patial_corr().
}
\description{
An interactive tool to assist in the visualization of the results from INDEED 
    functions non_partial_corr() or patial_corr(). The size and the color of each node can be 
    adjusted by users to represent either the Node_Degree, Activity_Score, Z_Score, or P_Value.
    The color of the edge is based on the binary value of either 1 corresonding to a positive 
    correlation dipicted as green or a negative correlation of -1 dipicted as red. The user also 
    has the option of having the width of each edge be proportional to its weight value. The 
    layout of the network can also be customized by choosing from the options: 'nice', 'sphere', 
    'grid', 'star', and 'circle'. Nodes can be moved and zoomed in on. Each node and edge will 
    display extra information when clicked on. Secondary interactions will be highlighted as 
    well when a node is clicked on.
