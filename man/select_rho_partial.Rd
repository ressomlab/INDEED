\title{Data preprocessing for partial correlaton analysis}
\usage{
select_rho_partial(
  data = NULL,
  class_label = NULL,
  id = NULL,
  error_curve = "YES"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{This is a matrix of expression from all biomolecules and all samples.}

\item{class_label}{This is a binary array with 0 for group 1 and 1 for group 2.}

\item{id}{This is an array of biomolecule IDs.}

\item{error_curve}{This is an option on whether a error curve plot will be
provided to the user, user can choose "YES" or "NO". The default is YES.}
}
\value{
A list of processed data for the next step, and generates an error curve to select rho 
    for graphical lasso.
}
\description{
A method that integrates differential expression (DE) analysis
    and differential network (DN) analysis to select biomarker candidates for
    cancer studies. select_rho_partial is the pre-processing step for INDEED
    partial differential analysis.
}
\examples{
select_rho_partial(data = Met_GU, class_label = Met_Group_GU, id = Met_name_GU, 
    error_curve = "YES")
}
